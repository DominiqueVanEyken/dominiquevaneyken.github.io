        <p>Hi, my name is Dominique!</p>

      <img src="./assets/dominique.jpg" alt="A photo of Dominique">
      <p>At the moment I am studying Information Technology at college while also working a full time job. Before making the switch to IT I actually graduated as a Physical Education teacher, which will probably explain most of what you will see on this webpage.</p>
      <p>When I am not working or studying I like to keep myself busy. For this I have a few (probably to many) hobbies. Like more and more people, I like to read as much as possible. For relaxation I usually grab a fantasy book, but I also try to broaden my knowledge about general subjects going from evolutions in our society to more sensitive topics like equality, racism, etc.</p>
      <p>Beside reading, I also try(!!) to maintain an active lifestyle. Weekly you will find me in the climbing gym, out on the road for a morning run or for a walk in nature. When the occassion permits it, I like to do those walks in the mountains while trying to reach a summit or trekking across a mountain range.</p>
      <p>Most of these sports go well with photography, which is one of the things I really like to do when out in nature. Usually I focus on climbing, nature or adventure photography, but I sometimes can't help but bring to camera to small events with friends. The downside to this... I have no photos of myself. You'll see all of them all while going through this webpage.</p>
