      <h2>What is climbing and why would you do it?</h2>
      <header>
        <p>In my previous job I used to work for the federation that was responsible for the development of the sports. My task there was what we call coordination of sportsclimbing (i.e. indoor climbing) which which contained the development of the regional and national competitions and the growth and development of the sport. Since this is thus my area of expertise I will focus mainly on this discipline.</p>

      <p>Climbing is one of these crazy sports that has become a real hype ever since it got on to the Olympics. While climbing is becoming a hobby for a lot of people, it used to be a sport that was regarded more often than not as a recreational activity like going to an attraction parc. In the last few years it has known an exponential growth which means the sport will be changing over the next few years.</p>
      <p>Now what is climbing exactly? Climbing is a sport you can practice indoors as well as outdoors. Both have their own pros and cons and for most even their own community. At the beginning of the climbing-era indoor climbing used to be a way to train for outdoor conquests either on rock or in the mountains. However the preparation part hasn't disappeared, the main focus in indoor climbing pre-Olympic was competition. Nowadays we see more and more a shift towards climbing for fitness.</p>
      <p>In sportsclimbing there are three disciplines, namely: <em>Lead, Speed and Boulder</em>. Let's asume you know nothing about climbing and competitions, what would you think a competition in climbing would look like? I bet it has something to do with scaling a wall as fast as possible. And you are not completely wrong. Besides in the Speed discipline, the speed element is actually a minor aspect of the sport. In Speed you really try to be faster than the person climbing next to you on an identical route. Think about the 100m sprint in athletics but on a 15m wall. Lead on the otherhand has a route that is at least 15m long and the athletes try to get as high as possible. Boulder meanwhile is a lot shorter. Here you try to scale a 4m wall where you need to find a what to reach the top.</p>
      <p>Why is climbing so interesting? Well more in Boulder than the other disciplines (though the point remains valid) you have to find a way to the top. The way you need to move is not as clear as a straight line and you body has to take unusual positions to be able to reach the next hold. This creates an imensly phyisical routine to get all the way to the top because you are just hanging on your fingertips while doing these movements. Besides the phyiscal aspect, there is an equally big mental aspect. You can be as strong and technical as you want, if you can't control you emotions/thoughts or focus on the wall, you won't be on it for very long.</p>
      <p>I will keep it at this for now, but there is a lot more to it than what I just explained. In fact, I can probably talk about climbing for hours. Yet I find that if you really want to know what climbing is, I'll take you to where the magic happens... <em>the climbing gym!</em></p>
